# Major Arcana

##  0. The Fool:

While the Fool is on the board, a player can harvest in that field by playing a card that, when added to a card in the Fool's field, matchest the value of another card in that field. (For instance, a player could harvest an 11 and a 5 by playing a six.)

##  1. The Magician:

While the Magician is on the board, any harvests made in the Magician's field must be stacked face down under the Magician. Additionally, players may stockpile and harvest on the same turn in the Magician's field (if the season allows these actions). When you claim the Magician, add all face down cards under the Magician to your harvest.

##  2. The High Priestess:

When the High Priestess is revealed, flip the draw pile upside down. As long as the High Priestess remains on the board, all drawn cards are public knowledge. When you claim the High Priestess, flip the draw pile back to its proper position, and you may look at one unrevealed Luminary if any remain.

##  3. The Empress:

When the Empress is revealed, remove all winter cards currently on the Empress's field from play. While she is on the board, any time a player would harvest a winter card from any field, remove it from play instead. At the end of the round, if you collected the Empress and are Sunkissed, take an additional 2 points.

##  4. The Emperor:

While the Emperor is on the board, if a player harvests a crop in his field, that player may add an additional card from the draw pile to their harvest for every card they harvest matching the suit of the card they played. (For instance, if a player plays the 7 of summer to harvest a 7 of winter, a 4 of summer, and a 3 of summer, the player would add two extra cards to their harvest.)

##  5. The Hierophant:

While the Hierophant is on the board, any player may use their rules card as a wild card in the Hierophant's field (that is, treat it as any real card in the suit Stars). If a player does this, rather than being added to the harvest when the rules card is harvested, it is instead returned to the player as a reference. At the end of the round, if you claimed the Hierophant, you may count your rules card in your harvest as though it were a Summer card.

##  6. The Lovers:

While the Lovers are on the board, players may stockpile in their field using crops from any adjacent field as long as at least one crop is coming from the Lovers' field. At the end of the round, if you have claimed the Lovers, all ties automatically break in your favor.

##  7. The Chariot:

When the Chariot is revealed, reseed 9 crops instead of the usual 3. While it remains on the board, if you harvest in the Chariot's field, you may harvest as many times as you would like in a turn. When you claim the Chariot, you may draw another Luminary and claim it as well, ignoring any of its effects.

##  8. Strength:

While Strength is on the board, you may harvest in its field only by playing a card higher than the value of the crop(s) or stockpile you are harvesting (for instance, you may only harvest a 2 with a 3 or higher, and you can harvest any combination of cards with lower than the card you are playing).

##  9. The Hermit:

While the Hermit is on the board, any time everybody takes a turn without interacting with the Hermit's field a crop in the field is removed. If the field is cleared in this way, the Hermit is removed from play. If you have claimed the hermit, you may remove it from play after any player's turn to take an extra turn out of order.

## 10. Wheel Of Fortune:

When Wheel of Fortune is revealed, draw 2 more Luminaries and reveal them. Until Wheel of Fortune is collected, these two Luminaries will remain revealed in Wheel of Fortune's field, with their effects taking place as usual; however, when the field is cleared only Wheel of Fortune is collected, while the others are removed from play.

## 11. Justice:

When Justice is revealed, the player with the most okus tokens must return one to the middle. While Justice is on the board, any harvests made in Justice's field are placed in a face down pile underneath Justice. When Justice is claimed, the pile is evenly split between all players.

## 12. The Hanged Man:

While the Hanged Man is on the board, any player may, after any player takes their turn, remove from play the most recent of their harvested cards and one of the cards in any field. They may also elect to remove the five most recent of their harvested cards from play to immediately clear the Hanged Man's field. If a field is cleared through either of these actions, all cards in it are removed from play and, if the Hanged Man's field is not the one that is cleared, the Luminary is swapped for the Hanged Man before the player claims it (such that the player will always claim the Hanged Man for clearing in this way.)

## 13. Death:

While Death is on the board, all seasons are treated as Spring and stockpiling is not allowed. If you have claimed Death, when the draw pile is empty, you may perform actions in any field with your remaining turns without regard for season.

## 14. Temperance:

While Temperance is on the board, if a player claims a stockpile that they did not create in Temperance's field, one card is deducted from their harvest. If you have claimed Temperance, at any point before the round ends you may remove Temperance from play and compel a player not to make the move they were about to make.

## 15. The Devil:

When the Devil is revealed, all currently sown crops are moved into the Devil's field, and the season for that field is changed to winter. When the Devil is first claimed, you may swap it with a Luminary another player has claimed and activate its effect for when it is claimed.

## 16. The Tower:

When the Tower is revealed, all players must remove their hands from play and draw a new hand, with each player drawing one card at a time in clockwise order around the table. When you claim the Tower, you may compel one player to remove their hand from play and draw a new hand. If the draw pile is depleted, you must still remove your hand from play, and if it is depleted in the course of drawing a new hand play will continue with the partial hand.

## 17. The Star:

While the Star is on the board, any time a player plays a card from the Stars suit in it's field they may elect to change the season even if it is not a face card. At the end of the hand, if you have collected the Star, any cards that would have been put out of play at the end of the hand are instead added to your harvest. (If you are playing without the Stars suit, remove this Luminary from play. Draw and reveal a new Luminary to replace this.)

## 18. The Moon:

While the Moon is on the board, once per turn any player can choose one card from any other player's hand and view that card. When you claim the Moon, you may, if you wish, harvest your entire hand and draw a new one.

## 19. The Sun:

When the Sun is revealed, each player must draw a card. While the Sun is on the board, the number of cards a player can have in their hand is increased to 5. When you claim the Sun, each player (including you) must choose one card from their hand and add it to your harvest.

## 20. Judgement:

While Judgement is on the board, any face cards played in its field will have their suit treated as Stars (i. e., the player can choose which season to change that field to). If you have claimed Judgement, at the end of any player's turn you may remove Judgement from play and change the season to any you choose.

## 21. The World:

When the World is revealed, the table may vote to end the round immediately. If a majority of players vote for it, the round ends immediately. If you have claimed the World, at any point you may remove it from play to call another vote to end the round immediately. In this case, a tie will break in your favour and the round will end.
